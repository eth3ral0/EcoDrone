# 🌱 EcoDrone – VTOL Hybrid Drone Project (Educational Purpose)

**EcoDrone** is an **educational project** developed as part of the **2025 Engineering Sciences Olympiad (Olympiades de Sciences de l'Ingénieur)**.

This GitHub repository focuses **only on the software and data acquisition aspects** of the project, as I was personally in charge of the **SIN (Information and Digital Systems)** domain.

> ⚠️ I do **not cover** the structural, aerodynamic or mechanical design of the aircraft, as they were handled by other team members in ITEC specialization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

EcoDrone is a **VTOL hybrid drone-airplane** capable of:
- **Vertical takeoff using 4 motors**
- Switching to **gliding mode using 2 motors** in cruise flight
- Logging and monitoring **current consumption** to study energy optimization

The context of the project was to think of a more energy-efficient and faster alternative in the field of delivery (pharmaceutical products, food, etc.).
The goal is to explore __innovative solutions__ to improve the **energy efficiency** of lightweight aerial systems by combining the **advantages of drones, helicopters, and airplanes**.

## 🧰 Prerequisite (SIN scope)

- The aircraft model we'll be using is **Krick Klemm L 25d E 1:7 kit** [link](https://www.r-models.eu/kits-a-construire/1151-avion-en-kit-klemm-l25d-e-lasercut-1859mm-krick-402579214391.html)

- **Arduino UNO** (data logging & sensor acquisition)
- **4x A2212 13T 1000Kv Brushless Motor**
- **2X SG90 9g Micro Servo**
- **ACS712** current sensor
- **DC0-25V** voltage sensor

### Tools/Softwares used

- **Arduino IDE** (C++)
- **digital laser tachometer**
- **multimeter**
- **SolidWork** (for the simulation)

## ❗Getting Started – Project Workflow

In this project, my role was to :
- Design the Arduino programs for the quadrotor vertical takeoff mode and the twin-engine horizontal glide mode.
- Study the energy consumption of these 2 operating modes

## 🔍 Study of the A2212 Brushless Motor
🎯 __Objective :__

This section presents the analysis of the **A2212 1000KV brushless motor** behavior based on the **PWM pulse width** applied via Arduino.  
The study aims to model the **current**, **power**, and **RPM** responses to help optimize energy use in our hybrid drone system.

### 1. Current vs. PWM Pulse Width

Using the collected data, we established the relationship between **current (I)** and **PWM pulse width**.  
The best-fit model is a **quadratic regression** *(using ChatGPT)*: 

$$I = -7.399880 × 10⁻⁷ × PWM² + 2.824110 × 10⁻³ × PWM - 1.979421$$

This equation allows us to predict the **current consumption** based on the PWM signal.

### 2. Power vs. PWM Pulse Width

The electric power was calculated using the formula:

$$P = U x I$$

Assuming a constant voltage **U**, we obtained the following **linear regression** to model power (W) as a function of PWM:

$$W = 0.007211 × PWM - 4.429927$$

### 3. RPM vs. PWM Pulse Width

We also analyzed the **rotational speed (RPM)** in relation to PWM. The resulting model is:

$$RPM = 18.106667 × PWM - 16202.666667$$

### 4. RPM vs. Current (I)

To link **electrical consumption** to **mechanical behavior**, we derived the following polynomial equation:

$$RPM = -2.490250 × 10⁴ × I² + 4.898924 × 10⁴ × I - 9132.579$$

### Conclusion of this study : 

*There is a pdf version of this study if you need it.*

This experiment helped characterize the **electrical and mechanical response** of the A2212 motor to varying PWM signals.  
We established equations for:
- **Current** as a function of PWM
- **Power** as a function of PWM
- **RPM** as a function of both PWM and Current

🔬 To improve precision in future experiments, we recommend using **four more accurate current sensors (0–0.9 A range)** to capture finer variations during motor tests.

## 🧪 Real-Life Tests – Motor Control & Rotation System

After modeling the motor’s behavior, we moved on to testing it **physically** using Arduino.  
The tests were performed progressively to validate each component of the propulsion and transition system.

### 🔹 1. Test with a Single Motor

We began by testing a single brushless motor using:
- An **ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)**
- A **PWM signal** generated by Arduino
- A **manual ramp-up** to observe changes in speed and current

💡 *Purpose:* validate PWM control and current logging on one motor safely.

### 🔹 2. Test with 4 Motors Simultaneously

Once the single motor test was validated, we connected all **4 motors** and ESCs to simulate the **vertical takeoff (VTOL) configuration**.

We implemented:
- **Synchronized PWM output** to 4 ESCs
- Gradual increase in speed
- Observation of **power draw and stability**

⚠️ The setup was very powerful and required secure mounting during testing.

📁 Code: [`/code/test_4_motors.ino`](final_prog/final_prog.ino)

### ✅ Summary of Results

- 🧠 Each component responded correctly to Arduino commands
- ⚙️ The ESCs successfully handled the load under test
- 🔁 The servo rotation mechanism worked as expected
- ⚠️ Safety measures were necessary due to **high thrust**
