# üå± EcoDrone ‚Äì VTOL Hybrid Drone Project (Educational Purpose)

**EcoDrone** is an **educational project** developed as part of the **2025 Engineering Sciences Olympiad (Olympiades de Sciences de l'Ing√©nieur)**.

This GitHub repository focuses **only on the software and data acquisition aspects** of the project, as I was personally in charge of the **SIN (Information and Digital Systems)** domain.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è I do **not cover** the structural, aerodynamic or mechanical design of the aircraft, as they were handled by other team members in ITEC specialization.

## üìå Project Overview

EcoDrone is a **VTOL hybrid drone-airplane** capable of:
- **Vertical takeoff using 4 motors**
- Switching to **gliding mode using 2 motors** in cruise flight
- Logging and monitoring **current consumption** to study energy optimization

The context of the project was to think of a more energy-efficient and faster alternative in the field of delivery (pharmaceutical products, food, etc.).
The goal is to explore __innovative solutions__ to improve the **energy efficiency** of lightweight aerial systems by combining the **advantages of drones, helicopters, and airplanes**.



## üß† Prerequisite (SIN scope)

- **Arduino UNO** (data logging & sensor acquisition)
- **4x A2212 13T 1000Kv brushless motor**
- **ACS712** current sensor
- **C++ / Arduino IDE**
- **Serial monitoring & data logging (.txt)**
- Signal modulation: **PWM control for motors**
- Plotting and modeling of power curves (Python or Excel)
